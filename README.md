## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git** - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **A code editor** - We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **A modern web browser** - Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
- **Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

### Installation

1. **Fork this repository**
   
   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy.

2. **Clone your forked repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fsoc-medium-challenge.git
   cd fsoc-medium-challenge
   ```

3. **Open the project**
   
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
   
   Or open the folder in your preferred code editor.

4. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
   
   You can use a local server extension like Live Server in VS Code, or simply open the file directly.

### API Setup

This project uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** for weather functionality.

#### Steps:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
3. Navigate to your API keys section
4. Copy your API key
5. Open `script.js` in your code editor
6. Find this line:
   ```javascript
   const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
   ```
7. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   const API_KEY = "abc123xyz456"; // Your actual key
   ```

**Note:** Keep your API key secure and never commit it to a public repository in production projects.
