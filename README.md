- Toggle between a light and dark theme.
- Persist their tasks even after refreshing the page.

## 🔑 API Setup

This project uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather data.  
Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and create a **free account**.  
2. Generate an **API Key** from your dashboard.  
3. Open the file `script.js` and replace the placeholder:  

```js
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
```
